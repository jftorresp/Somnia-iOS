#### CocoaPods

You have to add Pods to your project by creating a Podfile with the command `pod init` in terminal. You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install all the different dependencies of the app by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!
  pod 'Firebase/Analytics'
  pod 'Firebase/Auth'
  pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
  pod 'FBSDKLoginKit'
  pod 'IQKeyboardManagerSwift'
  pod 'Firebase/Storage'

```

Then run `pod install` to add all the libraries to your Xcode project. Then you have to open the app following the xcworkspace file.

#### Build & Run
1. After installing the pods, open Xcode and hit `command B` to Build the app.
2. Select a device in the emulator on the top-left corner of Xcode (preferably iPhone 11) or connect your iOS device to install the app on it.
3. Then hit `command R`or the 'play' button to run the app.
4. Congratulations your app is running!
